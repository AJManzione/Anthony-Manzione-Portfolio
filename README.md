# Anthony Manzione's Portfolio Project>

## A place for anyone to see Anthony Manzione's portfolio of work!


- The Motivation for this project is to create a web-page for any future employer or customer to view projects that have been deployed by me.
- I built this project to allow anyone of interest to see my current up to date portfolio and to acts as a portfolio element in itself to display my knowledge of web development.
- It solves the problem of being potentially unidentifyable within the web development industry and allows for people of interest to have the freedom to discover who I am as a developer and to learn more about me.
- I learned how to create a website.
