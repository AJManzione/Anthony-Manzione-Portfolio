## A place for anyone to see Anthony Manzione's portfolio of work!


- The Motivation for this project is to create a web-page for any future employer or customer to view projects that have been deployed by me.
- I built this project to allow anyone of interest to see my current up to date portfolio and to acts as a portfolio element in itself to display my knowledge of web development.
- It solves the problem of being potentially unidentifyable within the web development industry and allows for people of interest to have the freedom to discover who I am as a developer and to learn more about me.
- I learned how to create a website.


## Responsive at different screen widths 

   The challenge of this project was getting the website to function properly and display cleanly all of the content inside while being at any screen size. I know that not all webasites are going to be viewed at full size and sometimes websites will be viewed on mobile, for this we used several advanced CSS features to solve the problem.
